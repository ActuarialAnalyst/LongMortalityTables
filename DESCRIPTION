Description: The SOA maintains a collection of mortality tables. Select and ultimate tables are in a wide format.
    This enables users to call INDEX MATCH MATCH to calculate expected mortality for a particular issue age and duration. 
    If we want to use a JOIN type operation, the data must be reformatted into a long format. This package is a collection
    of mortality data that is never in a wide format so that it can always be easily joined.
